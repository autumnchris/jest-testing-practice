# Jest Testing Practice

A collection of JavaScript functions with accompanying Jest tests for each one that checks to see if the functions work as designed.

Inspired by the [Testing Practice assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice) as part of the curriculum for the [JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
